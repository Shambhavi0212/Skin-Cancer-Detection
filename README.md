 
## Model Download 
 
The trained model file (`model.h5`) is **not included** in this repo due to its large size. 
 
You can download the model from Google Drive here: 
[Download model.h5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b4My7rzV7vpNann9PZuhxiYyBBVryPZs/view?usp=drive_link) 
 
After downloading, place the `model.h5` file in the folder `cancer_detection_model/` locally before running the code.
